An example project demonstrating use of [`CSDL2.swift`](https://github.com/jaz303/CSDL2.swift) and [`SDL2.swift`](https://github.com/jaz303/SDL2.swift).

## Usage

  - clone this repository
  - `$ ./init`
  - `$ make`
  - `$ ./main`

If SDL is installed somewhere other than `/usr/local/lib` you must update `Makefile` as well as `module.map` in [`CSDL2.swift`](https://github.com/jaz303/CSDL2.swift).
